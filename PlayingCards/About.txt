This is a code sample created by Peter Reding (Peter.reding3@gmail.com) for a potential employer.

2. Write a method, function, or procedure that randomly shuffles a standard deck of 52 playing cards.

No UI reqs were given but a simple UI was added to illistrate the functionality of the code. It is ugly
and will refresh your whole page any time you do anything. The end purpose of the deck is to be used in 
multiple games that will provide their own UI. No Unit tests were built for the UI for this same reason.
